# MR-Obstacle-Courses

### Description

This project is currently entered into the UNM app contest, sponsored by Adobe. In its current basic form, this app allows the 
user to spawn obstacles and targets, and to run around with an AR/VR headset to destroy the targets while avoiding the obstacles.
Although primitive, this project can serve as a starting point for all kinds of mixed reality experiences.

### Features

![Movement and Dialogue](https://j.gifs.com/16B3Bm.gif)

I started by making a player entity that moves and rotates with user input. Then, I created a basic dialogue menu that appears
when a character is approached. The character can choose between dialogue options to respond to the character they approached.

Next, I created a menu that allows the user to arrange words into phrases. The menu has drag and drop functionality, as well as
a button that responds to correct or incorrect input.
