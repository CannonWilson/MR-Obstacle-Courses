# MR-Obstacle-Courses

### Description

This project is currently entered into the UNM app contest, sponsored by Adobe. In its current basic form, this app allows the 
user to spawn obstacles and targets, and to run around with an AR/VR headset to destroy the targets while avoiding the obstacles.
Although primitive, this project can serve as a starting point for all kinds of mixed reality experiences. Please check back
in a bit for some footage of what the app looks like inside the headset.
